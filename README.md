|**#fintechdevcon2023**|**Secure software demystified**|


This is the code repository for a workshop given at [fintech_devcon 2023](https://fintechdevcon.io/full-agenda/) titled **"Secure software demistifyed: data security practices"**

During the workshop, a microservice application will be refactored to improve security aligned with the [OWASP Top10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) categories for web application security risks. The microservice application contains and an API, a background worker, and a database. It runs in Kubernetes using Traefik as the network interface.

The workshop is designed to teach security principles, as opposed to making specific technology choices. Its goal is to help developers improve the security of their applications by implementing zero trust, updating default framework configurations, adding sensitive data protection, and monitoring events for anomalies.

## Setup üëÄ

<details>
<summary>Install kubectl, k3s and Docker</summary>


tl;dr
- Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- Install and configure [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/installation) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.5.2/) depending on your local operating system
- If using `k3d`, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- **or** if you have an existing Kubernetes cluster running with administrative rights, you can skip this setup

### Overview

This application runs as microservices in Kubernetes. To work through the steps locally, we recommend using [Rancher k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s), a lightweight Kubernetes installation that is "easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB."

### macOS

If you are using macOS, use [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.5.2/) to run k3s. "k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s in docker." So you will need docker installed on your local machine.

### Linux (or WSL2)

If you are using Windows with WSL2, you can install k3s without docker. We recommend downloading the [k3s binary directly](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration#configuration-with-binary) instead of using the setup script provided by Rancher. The binary is "useful when performing quick tests that do not merit managing K3s as a system service", which is suitable for this workshop.

```
 wget -q "https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/download/v1.25.11%2Bk3s1/k3s" -O /tmp/k3s
 sudo mv /tmp/k3s /usr/local/bin/k3s
 sudo chmod u+x bin/k3s
 k3s --version
```

You should see the following output:

```
$ k3s --version
k3s version v1.25.11+k3s1 (582f07cf)
go version go1.19.10
```

To run k3s, use the following command:
```
sudo K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" k3s server
```

After starting the server for the first time, various configuration files will be added to your OS. For example, to use `kubectl` with the k3s cluster, simply export the Rancher configuration file as an environment variable:

```
$ export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
$ kubectl get pods
```

## Workshop exercisesüìù

The microservice application in this workshop starts with a multi-tier architecture that is common to many web applications. It includes an API, background jobs and a database.

![Starting application architecture](./data/images/fintech_devcon-workshop-arch-start.svg)

After making various software and infrastructure changes, the architecture will evolve to include an API gateway, a database gateway, and an observability stack.

![Ending application architecture](./data/images/fintech_devcon-workshop-arch-end.svg)

This workshop has the following sections

* [A01:2021 Broken Access Control](#a01-2021-broken-access control)

### A01:2021 Broken Access Control

The first risk of the OWASP Top 10 is "Broken Access Control".

We will upgrade our API to add both authentication and authorization.

While it is common for external APIs to have basic authentication in place, we will also use authentication for internal requests, such as those coming from our background job. The reason for this is to harden our application against "inside threats", where another internal application has been compromised and attackers are using it to exfiltrate data from our APIs.

This is often called "zero trust", and the idea is that no requests received by the API should be trusted, even if it is coming from inside our own cloud or network.

<details>
<summary>Go deeper</summary>

Historically, "network segmentation", or separating applications by connectivity via a network, has been considered a practical security technique. For example, a company intranet may allow applications to freely connect to other applications on the same intranet.

Like a locked front door of a house, a security team must only ensure that authorized applications or devices connect to this network. That will ensure that malicious actors don't steal data, as they won't be allowed inside.

However this approach has been proven to be ineffective in modern environments, as the number and diversity of applications has grown significantly. Just this year, in 2023, we have seen a hack related to a file transfer utility called MOVEIt [leak data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach) from thousands of organizations.

While you may think that your backend environment is straightforward or well protected today, this won't be the case as your company or product scales. Retrofitting hundreds of microservices with inter-service authentication would be a huge undertaking down the road.

</details>

In addition to authentication, we will introduce authorization to individual API endpoints. This will give us the ability to generate credentials that only allow a subset of the API functionality to be invoked.

This is implementing the concept of "least privilege", where users or clients are only allowed to perform the operations that they need. It will also let us map API functions to different personas or roles, such as an administrator vs a normal user.

### Introducing JSON Web Tokens

JSON Web Tokens, aka JWTs, are most useful for web application auth. They can be validated as authentically generated by our application (as opposed to generated by an attacker), can include information about the client making the request (such as a user id), are fairly tamper-proof, and can be set to expire after some time. Technically speaking, they are semi-structured Javascript Objects (JSON) that gets encoded into a string using base64url.

> Here's a sample JWT - [eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c](https://jwt.io)

A JWT will be passed in an HTTP request header for all requests made to our API, and the API will validate the JWT before processing the request. Easy! (The only downside is that they are long strings, but other than that pretty perfect for auth).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Information in a JWT is not secure, and they shouldn't include sensitive information like customer PII. Anyone can easily decode a JWT, just using tools or even the website [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/). JWTs should also be treated like passwords, and not committed into source code or shared publicly.

#### Adding JWT authentication to Express

We'll use a NodeJS library `jsonwebtoken` to generate and validate our JWTs. And we'll load a signing secret, used to generate and validate tokens, from an environment variable using the library `dotenv`.

First let's add that library as a dependency to our API application. Update the [package.json](src/api/package.json) -

```diff
// src/api/package.json
{
  "name": "api",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "config": "^3.3.9",
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
+    "dotenv": "~16.3.0",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
+    "jsonwebtoken": "~9.0.0", 
    "morgan": "~1.9.1",
    "pg": "^8.11.1",
    "sequelize": "^6.32.1"
  }
}
```

Now generate the signing key. This should be kept a secret! It's how the application will know that a token is valid.

Generate some randomness - [https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=64&format=h](https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=64&format=h)

Turn it into a single string by copying and pasting the random bytes into this CyberChef recipe - [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Remove_whitespace(true,true,true,true,true,false)](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Remove_whitespace(true,true,true,true,true,false))

Now you should have something that looks like this - `d318959b6b72c59433baf12fbf9d7c784d1b0b04f0399a63424a04a739283ac663e2a78d4139ae78dd9318999372caf707df14222a018a0333beb8265c92c150`

# TODO is this the right way to include secrets?
Add it to the API's [Dockerfile](src/api/Dockerfile) as an environment variable by replacing `[your token]` -

```diff
// src/api/Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

ENV NODE_ENV=production
+ENV TOKEN_SECRET=[your token]

RUN apk add --no-cache tini
```

Next up, let's add some code to our API [index.js](src/api/routes/index.js)  to generate tokens for our API. First load the secret from the environment variable -

```diff
// src/api/routes/index.js
const express = require('express');
+const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
+require("dotenv").config();
const router = express.Router();
+const token_secret = process.env.TOKEN_SECRET;

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
    res.status(404).json({error: "not found"});
});

module.exports = router;
```

And now an endpoint to generate a JWT -

```diff
// src/api/routes/index.js
//...

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
    res.status(404).json({error: "not found"});
});

+app.post('/createToken', (_req, res) => {
+  const data = { username: req.body.username }
+  const token = jwt.sign(username, token_secret, { expiresIn: '1800s' });
+
+  res.json(token);
+});

module.exports = router;
```

Next, we'll create a middleware for Express to validate a JWT. Let's add a function that can validate a token. In [src/api](src/api/) create a file called `auth.js` -

```javascript
// src/api/auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const headerRegex = /^Bearer (.+)$/i

export function authenticate(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  // authorization header is of the format "Bearer token"
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.match(headerRegex);

  if (token == null) return res.sendStatus(401)

  jwt.verify(token[1], process.env.TOKEN_SECRET as string, (err, data) => {
    
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return res.sendStatus(401);
    }

    req.jwt = token[1];
    req.user = data;

    next();
  })
}
```

This function will verify that a token is valid: signed by the secret and not expired. It also assigns the token and token data to request variables called `jwt` and `user` respectively.

We can use this function for endpoints. Let's update the [user routes](src/api/routes/users.js) -

```diff
// src/api/routes/users.js
const express = require('express');
const { models } = require('../database');
+const { authenticate } = require('../authenticate);
const User = models.user;

const router = express.Router();

/* List all users. */
-router.get('/', async function(req, res, next) {
+router.get('/', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Get a single user by ID. */
-router.get('/:id', async function(req, res, next) {
+router.get('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Create a new user. */
-router.post('/', async function(req, res, next) {
+router.post('/', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Update an existing user by ID. */
-router.put('/:id', async function(req, res, next) {
+router.put('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Delete an existing user by ID. */
-router.delete('/:id', async function(req, res, next) {
+router.delete('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

module.exports = router;

```

Now each of these routes will require a valid JWT header to be present in the request to process it. Otherwise it will return a 401 response. We can make the same updates to the endpoints in [transactions.js](src/api/routes/transactions.js)

#### Adding authorization

Now that we have basic authentication in place, the next step is to add authorization. This will allow us to issue tokens that can only access some of the endpoints in our API.

First we'll add a list of permissions to the JWT that we generate. Let's update our token -

```diff
// src/api/routes/index.js
//...

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
    res.status(404).json({error: "not found"});
});

app.post('/createToken', (_req, res) => {
-  const data = { username: req.body.username }
+  const data = { username: req.body.username, permissions: req.body.permissions }
  const token = jwt.sign(username, token_secret, { expiresIn: '1800s' });

  res.json(token);
});

module.exports = router;
```

Next we'll add an authorization middleware function to `auth.js``. We wrap the middleware function with a parameter, allowing us to specify a permission that must be included in the JWT's user data -

```diff
// src/api/auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const headerRegex = /^Bearer (.+)$/i

export function authenticate(req, res, next) {
  //...
}

+export function authorize(permission) {
+  return (req, res, next) => {
+    const user = req.user
+
+    if (user && user.permissions.includes(permission)) {
+      next();
+    }
+
+    return res.sendStatus(401)
+  }
+}
```

Now let's update the endpoints that can create or update users to be accessible only to tokens with a `modify:user` permission in [users.js](src/api/routes/users.js) -

```diff
// src/api/routes/users.js
const express = require('express');
const { models } = require('../database');
-const { authenticate } = require('../authenticate);
+const { authenticate, authorize } = require('../authenticate);
const User = models.user;

const router = express.Router();

/* List all users. */
router.get('/', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Get a single user by ID. */
router.get('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Create a new user. */
-router.post('/', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
+router.post('/', [authenticate, authorize("modify:user")], async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Update an existing user by ID. */
-router.put('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
+router.put('/:id', [authenticate, authorize("modify:user")], async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

/* Delete an existing user by ID. */
-router.delete('/:id', authenticate, async function(req, res, next) {
+router.delete('/:id', [authenticate, authorize("modify:user")], async function(req, res, next) {
  //...
});

module.exports = router;

```

Now we're golden!
